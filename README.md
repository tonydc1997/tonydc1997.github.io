A sample website for Learn Enough CSS &amp; Layout to Be Dangerous

This is a rudimentary experiment into learning CSS &amp; and Layout through the Learn Enough to Be Dangerous course series.
Though I already have some knowledge of CSS I chose to experiment and see how this course turns out as I have had a very
positive experience with Learn Enough Git &amp; Command Line to Be Dangerous, not only in learning the most common features,
but in also learning about some of the best practices from someone who is actually in the industry and who walks you through 
errors and helps you resolve them. 

In other words, this will be a super messy project where I'm just throwing everything at the walls!
