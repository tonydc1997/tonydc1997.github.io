A sample website for [*Learn Enough CSS &amp; Layout to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial). I promise it's not that bad! [*Check it out here*](https://tonydc1997.github.io/).

This is an experiment into learning CSS &amp; and Layout through the [*Learn Enough to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/courses) course series.
Though I already have some knowledge of CSS I chose to experiment and see how this course turns out as I have had a very
positive experience with [*Learn Enough Git*](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial) &amp; [*Command Line to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial), not only in learning the most common features,
but in also learning about some of the best practices from [*Michael Hartl*](https://www.michaelhartl.com), someone who is actually in the industry and who walks you through 
errors and helps you resolve them. 

Learning and enforcing [*DRY principles*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself_) through site-templating program like [*Jekyll*](https://jekyllrb.com) is seriously awesome and I never knew how much easier it made the project as a whole. This allowed me to easily add complexity to the site in the form of blog posts and to be able to update or create new ones with remarkable ease.  

Lastly, this course also gives some top-notch advice on [*Search Engine Optimization (SEO)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization). So you not only learn how to make a responsive website that looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop views, but you learn how to improve your site's availability and ease of access on the web.

I hope you enjoy the [*website*](https://tonydc1997.github.io/) as much as I have!
